# kaldi-long-audio-alignment
Long audio alignment using Kaldi. The algorithm is similar to the one in SAILALIGN toolkit (https://github.com/nassosoassos/sail_align). 

Refer to "A RECURSIVE ALGORITHM FOR THE FORCED ALIGNMENT OF VERY LONG AUDIO SEGMENTS" and "A SYSTEM FOR AUTOMATIC ALIGNMENT OF BROADCAST MEDIA CAPTIONS USING WEIGHTED FINITE-STATE TRANSDUCERS" to get started.

NOTE: Adaptation after each pass has not been implemented yet.
